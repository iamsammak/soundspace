Binary Search Tree
  - Root Node
  - each node has right child, left child, both , neither
  - left child < parent
  - right > parent
  - right, left both BSTs too


A heap is a complete binary search tree, of a complete tree, full tree

binary search tree doesn't have to be full

Hibbard deletion


Balanced:
1. Diff in depths of left + right <= 1
2. Left sub balanced
3. Right sub balanced

In-order traversal - is a depth first search
1. in-order trav. of left
2. print root
3. in-order of right

post order traversal
pre order traversal
