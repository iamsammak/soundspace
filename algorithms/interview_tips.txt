don't accept the first job because this job will be where you're spending the next year
40 - 60 hours every week for the next year
make sure you want to be around these people and work with these people
and learn from these people

you have more experience than css graduates
you have hands on experience and pair programming exposure


talk about trajectory and how you went from writing a for loop to 9 weeks later writing a full on app
what can you do in another 9 weeks or 6 months

when its time for you to ask questions
ask technical questions
ask questions that show you know what it takes or what you need to be an engineer at that company
what is your tech stack
how code gets written and how code gets pushed out
TDD, ask them about testing code
- capybara
- you've done assessments so you have learned how to read specs and pass them

what are they hiring for
what problems are they trying to solve

if you see that most companies are using a specific framework, go learn that framework, read up on it

what's source control


get datapoints from each interview, then ask the next engineer what they are doing about said problem that you learned from the last interview
what are the reasons you are using all those tools
and what you should think about in those situations

if you end the interview without new information about the industry then you haven't spent your time wisely

who will be looking over my code
hopefully someone will read your code first
write test for it
see if it breaks anything
then it goes implemented with master

how is the onboarding period like

if the company has a great answer for that, might be a nice company to work for


if some gives you an exploding offer
ask them to extend
if then can't extend then tell them to compensate you for pulling yourself off the job market

they give you the exploding offer because they want you and they also want to be done interviewing

apply to jobs that use a different language, go learn it
you have a couple weeks

write good color
good documentation
why you made the decisions that you did
how much thought you put into it, for edge cases etc...

Negotiation
- it feels antagostic
- never settle for less
- no one is going to remember or care
- bonuses and payrise is all about percentages so make sure your initial is the best you can get

have it be easy for them to say yes

comparedly, look for engineer salary over time

negotiate salary then options/equities then signing bonus

emailed the job offers that she didn't take
email it to me in writing
even though she signed the offer she chose, three of them ask you to hop on the phone to talk more

I would love to work for you but there is this little thing, is there anything you can do about it
