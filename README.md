### Future Implementations

Different Libraries :

- [ ] More animations
- [ ] Utilize the bezier curve to draw custom animations
- [ ] Implement a library change on Spacebar keydown
- [ ] Library change means the color scheme of the animations and the sounds will all change. Almost like pseudo level change
- [ ] This future implementation will test my DRY code abilities (in the words of HIMYM "challenge accpeted!")
